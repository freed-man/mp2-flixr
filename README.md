## UX

### Project purpose
Flixr was created to solve the common problem of "choice paralysis" that occurs when browsing streaming platforms. Instead of spending 30+ minutes scrolling through endless options, users can quickly get personalized movie recommendations based on their current mood and available time.

### User goals
The website serves users who want to:
* Find movie recommendations quickly without endless browsing
* Discover films based on their current mood and time constraints
* Get surprised with random movie picks when feeling adventurous
* Avoid genres they're not in the mood for
* Have a simple, stress-free movie selection experience

### User stories

**As a tired user after work, I want:**
* To quickly find a relaxing movie that fits my 90-minute window before bed
* To avoid action or intense films when I just want to unwind
* To get recommendations without creating accounts or complex preferences

**As someone with friends over, I want:**
* To find a crowd-pleasing movie that everyone can enjoy
* To quickly see runtime so I know if we have enough time
* To get comedy or feel-good suggestions for group viewing

**As an indecisive viewer, I want:**
* A "surprise me" option when I can't decide what mood I'm in
* To avoid spending more time choosing than actually watching
* Simple yes/no choices rather than overwhelming filter options

**As a movie enthusiast, I want:**
* To discover films I might not have considered
* To filter out genres I'm currently not interested in
* To see movie details like rating and plot before committing

### Design

**Problem Solving Approach**
* The design prioritizes speed and simplicity over comprehensive features. Every interaction is designed to get users to a movie recommendation in under 30 seconds.

**Color Scheme**
* Clean, modern palette that works over background images
* Blue (#3498db) for interactive elements and consistency
* High contrast text with semi-transparent backgrounds for readability
* Minimal color palette to avoid decision fatigue

**Typography**
* Simple, readable fonts (Arial fallback for maximum compatibility)
* Bold text for better visibility over background images
* Consistent sizing hierarchy for easy scanning

**Layout Philosophy**
* Mobile-first responsive design
* Single-page application to minimize navigation
* Grid-based button layouts for easy touch interaction
* Prominent call-to-action buttons

**User Interface Decisions**
* Emoji icons for instant visual recognition (ðŸ˜‚ Laugh, ðŸŽ² Surprise Me)
* Large, touch-friendly buttons for mobile users
* Minimal form fields to reduce friction
* Progressive disclosure - only show what's needed when it's needed

**Wireframes**

These wireframes were developed using the software Balsamiq during the phase of the design and planning stages for this project.
